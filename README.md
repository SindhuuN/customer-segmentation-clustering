# customer-segmentation-clustering
Overview

This project focuses on *Customer Segmentation* using the *K-Means Clustering* algorithm. Customer segmentation is a crucial marketing strategy that enables businesses to identify and group customers based on various attributes, helping to tailor marketing campaigns, personalize experiences, and optimize business strategies.

In this project, we use unsupervised machine learning to cluster customers into distinct groups based on features like *annual income* and *spending score*. This segmentation provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.

üë• What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into smaller groups that share similar characteristics. These characteristics can include:

Demographics (age, gender, income)

Purchase behavior

Spending patterns

Engagement level

Why Is It Important?
Segmentation helps businesses tailor their approach to different customer types. For instance:

High-spending customers can receive loyalty rewards

Inactive users may be targeted with re-engagement campaigns

Younger demographics might prefer digital channels

Segmentation is foundational for data-driven marketing, allowing companies to treat different customer groups in unique and efficient ways rather than applying a one-size-fits-all strategy.

üìä What Is K-Means Clustering?
K-Means Clustering is a machine learning algorithm used to group data points into k non-overlapping subsets (clusters), where each data point belongs to the group with the closest mean (centroid). It‚Äôs a centroid-based, unsupervised algorithm that's both efficient and widely applicable in customer analytics.

How It Works:
Start with k random centroids

Assign each data point to the nearest centroid

Recalculate the centroids based on current cluster assignments

Repeat the process until the assignments no longer change or a set number of iterations is reached

Key Characteristics:
It‚Äôs fast and scalable to large datasets

Assumes clusters are convex and similar in size

Sensitive to outliers and initial centroid placement

K-Means is best suited for well-separated, spherical clusters and numeric data.

‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Steps (K-Means Logic)
The K-Means clustering process follows these logical steps:

Select the number of clusters (k)
Decide how many groups you want to divide your data into. This can be done manually or using heuristics like the Elbow Method.

Initialize Centroids
Choose k initial points as the starting centroids. These can be chosen randomly or using smarter methods like K-Means++.

Assign Points to Clusters
For each data point, calculate the distance (usually Euclidean) to each centroid and assign the point to the closest one.

Update Centroids
Calculate the new centroids by averaging the data points assigned to each cluster.

Repeat
Continue assigning and updating until:

The centroids no longer change significantly, or

A maximum number of iterations is reached

This method seeks to minimize intra-cluster variance, i.e., make data points in the same cluster as similar as possible.

üß™ Implementation
This project is implemented in Python using open-source libraries. The workflow includes data preparation, model training, cluster evaluation, and visualization.

Tools and Libraries:
pandas ‚Äì For data manipulation

numpy ‚Äì For numerical computations

matplotlib and seaborn ‚Äì For visualization

scikit-learn ‚Äì For K-Means and preprocessing

jupyter notebook ‚Äì For interactive analysis

Dataset Used:
We use the Mall Customers dataset, which contains the following features:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)

Process Breakdown:
Load and Explore Data

Understand the structure and basic stats of the dataset

Preprocessing

Remove irrelevant columns (e.g., CustomerID)

Encode categorical variables if needed

Normalize/standardize features for better clustering

Determine Optimal k

Use the Elbow Method: plot number of clusters vs. distortion (inertia) to find the point where adding more clusters no longer significantly improves performance

Fit K-Means

Train the model with the optimal k value

Predict cluster labels for each data point

Analyze Clusters

Assign meaningful names or characteristics to each cluster

Compare cluster centroids

Visualize Results

Plot clusters in 2D and 3D to reveal insights

üìà Visualizations
Visuals play a crucial role in understanding the output of K-Means. This project includes:

1. Elbow Method Plot
Helps determine the most appropriate number of clusters

Look for the "elbow" where adding more clusters yields diminishing returns

2. 2D Cluster Plots
Example: Annual Income vs. Spending Score

Points are colored based on their cluster label

3. 3D Cluster Plot
Visualizing three features (e.g., Age, Income, Spending Score)

Helps spot cluster overlap or separation

4. Pairplot & Heatmaps
Understand relationships between features across clusters

These plots make it easier to present and explain customer groupings to non-technical stakeholders.

üß† Results & Insights
After running K-Means with the optimal number of clusters (e.g., k = 5), we obtained meaningful customer segments. Example interpretations:

Cluster 1: High Income, High Spending

Loyal, premium customers

Potential candidates for VIP programs

Cluster 2: High Income, Low Spending

Possibly conservative spenders or new customers

Opportunity for targeted marketing or promotions

Cluster 3: Low Income, High Spending

Price-insensitive younger customers or impulse buyers

Cluster 4: Low Income, Low Spending

Least engaged group, potential to ignore or minimize spend

Cluster 5: Mid Income, Moderate Spending

Middle-of-the-road customers, stable revenue base

These insights can support campaign design, product development, and customer service strategies.

üß© Other Approaches
K-Means is simple and efficient, but it's not always the best fit for every dataset. Alternative clustering methods include:

1. Hierarchical Clustering
Builds a hierarchy of clusters using a tree-like structure (dendrogram)

Doesn't require the number of clusters in advance

Suitable for small to medium-sized datasets

2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
Forms clusters based on data density

Can detect outliers/noise and non-spherical clusters

No need to specify k

3. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
Probabilistic model assuming data is generated from a mixture of Gaussians

Allows soft cluster assignments (i.e., a point can belong to multiple clusters with certain probabilities)

4. PCA + Clustering
Reduces dimensionality first using Principal Component Analysis

Clustering then applied to principal components

Helps with high-dimensional data

You might try these methods if K-Means gives poor results, especially with non-spherical or highly varied clusters.
